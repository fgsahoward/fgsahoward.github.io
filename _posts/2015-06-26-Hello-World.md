Every online presence must begin somewhere. As this is a development blog it seems only fitting that it begin with the phrase "Hello World."  For decades a simple program announcing exactly that has been the first step of many a student into the murky waters of the computing sciences.

FoxGuard Solutions is company focused upon cybersecurity and compliance solutions.  While you will find some information on those subjects here, the purpose of this site is not to discuss these but rather to focus upon the craft of software development which underpins these broader corporate objectives.  

Note that opinions expressed here are not necessarily those of FoxGuard Solutions or its owners.  If you're looking for something more along the lines of the company writ large check out [the company blog](http://www.ccs-inc.com/blog).
